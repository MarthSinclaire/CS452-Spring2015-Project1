Project 1

The goal of the game is to collect a randomly positioned square as many times as possible within the time limit.
The player square is controlled with the WASD keys utilizing code from lab 2.
HTML tags for the remaining time and score are on the top and bottom of the play area, respectively.
There are issues with collision detection beyond the first couple points scored, I'm not exactly sure why that happens.
